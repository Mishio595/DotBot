# DotBot

DotBot is a private moderation bot designed specifically for my server, SAGA Sandwiches. It is still unstable and will not work outside of the support guild and the main guild unless the guild you want to add it to is completely compatible.

It is written using Javascript and the Discord.js library.

DotBot would not be possible without the overwhelming support of my friends, namely Tyler and Reed, and the help of Adelyn. Lyn has been so helpful and has assisted me so much in getting to learn to basics of coding and I'm so grateful I can't express it in words. Thank you so much
